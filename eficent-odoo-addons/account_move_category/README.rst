=====================
Account Move Category
=====================

This module adds a selection field in the account move line that helps to
identify special entries.

In this category we find adjustment entries for the end of a fiscal year or any
manual entry that comes out of the normal flow

This module passes the information to the analytic line so the analytic module
is needed.
